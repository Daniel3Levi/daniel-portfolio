              My favorite thing in life, the purpose of my life is problem
              solving, in any field not only in programming.
              <br />I think that programming is the most efficient way i know to
              work in what i love.
              <br />
              For me, programming is personal development.

              In my perspective, every person should develop their ability to
              solve problems, to learn the process of finding solutions, so i
              instill my attitude in everyone around me.
              <br /> I believe that with my attitude and abilities i can be an
              asset to your company.
